# Go Basic Project

This is a simple Go project that demonstrates basic Go concepts and a simple calculator package.

## Features

- A `main.go` file that demonstrates the usage of basic data structures in Go:
  - **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections of items of the same type.
  - **Slices**: Flexible, dynamically-sized views into the elements of an array.
  - **Maps**: Collections of key-value pairs.
- A `calculator` package that provides `Sum` and `Multiply` functions.
- Unit tests for the calculator package.

## How to Run

### Run the main application

The `main.go` file contains examples of how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays, slices, and maps. To see the output, run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Run the tests

To run the unit tests for the `calculator` package, use the following command:

```bash
go test ./...
```
